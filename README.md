## User Story

```
AS A music lover
I WANT to find and learn more about about musical events by searching any region and specifying a date span
SO THAT I can see when and where artists are playing, as well as seeing related information about them displayed directly alongside them
```

We envisioned a platform that would be ideal for when a user is interested in attending live musical events, and that could be anything from a massive performance to a small set at their local bar, but they don't know what musicians are in town or who they'd want to see. Our intended user would be tourists, travelers, and general enthusiasts who want to attend musical events in their area and learn about upcoming performances. So, we conceptualized the site to be a sort of discovery for the user, letting them find new artists. This platform allows them to enter in a date range and any location and see a suggested artisit who is playing at those times. Alongside this information users will also see a set of accompaying cards related to the artist, with info like their wikipedia profile or the event dates and venue locations.
