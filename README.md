## Discovery Guru

## Project Description
We envisioned a platform that would be ideal for when a user is interested in attending live musical events but they don't know who they'd want to see. This platform allows them to enter in a date range and any location and see a suggested artist who is playing at those times. Alongside this information users will also see a set of accompaying cards related to the artist, with info like their Wikipedia bio, event dates, and venue locations.

## User Story
```
AS A music lover
I WANT to find and learn more about about musical events by searching any region and specifying a date span
SO THAT I can see when and where artists are playing, as well as seeing related information about them displayed directly alongside them 
```
